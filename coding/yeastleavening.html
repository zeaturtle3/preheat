        <h2>Yeast & leavening</h2>
        <p>One of the most important aspects of baking bread is the yeast. But, what does yeast do?
             Here, we break down the details of the most essential part of breadmaking.</p>

            <h4>A living ingredient</h4>
            <p>Yeast is actually alive - they live and breathe, just like any other organism! 
                    They are a single-celled fungus that lies dormant until activated, which happens during
                    the breadmaking process when you add warm water. Once they “wake up,” the yeast feeds on the 
                    sugars in the flour and bread. As it eats, it releases carbon dioxide, which later helps promote airiness 
                    in the bread.</p>

            <h4>Letting it rise</h4>
            <p>Proofing, also known as rising, is an essential part of the breadmaking process. This is when the yeast becomes 
                activated and releases carbon dioxide, allowing the dough to rise. While proofing, cover your dough in plastic 
                wrap to retain moisture and place it in a warm place to assist in the rising process.<br>
                However, it can be easy to think that your bread just needs to be as puffy as possible. Sadly, it isn’t always 
                that easy. If the bread is over-proofed, it can be flat and have an odd texture. If it is under-proofed, it will 
                be dense and unpleasant. Moral of the story, let the recipe do its thing - follow the times recommended, and you 
                should be good!</p>
