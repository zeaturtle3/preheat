                <p>We all know what bread looks like, but what about the fine details of each part?</p>
                <p>
                Let’s start with the crust. How does a crust even form?<br>
                When a loaf bakes, a crust forms due to a couple of processes. Moisture evaporates from the surface, 
                causing the uppermost layers of dough to dry out and become rigid, and gluten (the elastic, protein 
                component of the dough) coagulates.<br>It is also do to the <b>Maillard reaction</b>, which is a chemical 
                reaction in which protein plus sugar plus heat creates browning. So the protein in the flour, plus 
                sugar, plus the heat of an oven create a beautiful crust!</p>

                <h4>Dough</h4>
                <p>How exactly does bread get that fluffy, chewy texture inside? Just like the crust, this formation 
                    of the bread, called the <b>crumb</b>, is created by many factors. The primary factor is gluten formation. 
                    When mixed with water, flour begins to create gluten strands. The gluten makes the dough stretchy. 
                    The gluten strands trap carbon dioxide within the dough, and as it bakes, the gas is released, 
                    producing an airy crumb.</p>
                <p>One way to check if your dough is ready for baking is the <b>windowpane test</b>. To do this test, take a piece 
                    of dough, stretch it thin, and hold it up to the light. If you can stretch it thin enough (without 
                    tearing) that light shines through, then it’s ready! This also allows you to see the strands of 
                    gluten forming in your bread.</p>

                <h4>Why weigh ingredients?</h4>
                <p>So, why do so many recipes want you to weigh your ingredients instead of measuring them with cups?
                    Well, the short answer is that baking is a science. A very precise one, in fact. Every ingredient 
                    needs to be measured exactly right, and weighing them is the most effective way to do so. While it
                    may seem that you can get consistent results through cup-measuring, the opposite is true. Your 
                    measurements can even vary from 3-4 tablespoons per cup, which is pretty significant! 
                    So next time you see weights alongside measurements, try the weights instead!</p>

            <span class="bodytext">
                <h4>Flour</h4>
                <p>Flour is an essential part of bread. Flour is rich in gluten, which is a protein that gives the dough 
                    its elasticity. It creates a network of gluten strands that create the shape and texture of your 
                    resulting bread.</p>
                <h4>Sweetener</h4>
                <p>While it may seem unnecessary, sweetener is actually a vital part of the breadmaking process. Yeast 
                    feeds on sweetener, which activates the yeast, and provides the delicious bread flavor and texture. 
                    It also allows for the Maillard reaction to occur on the crust!</p>
