            <p>It can definitely vary by the type of bread you make, and also how you store it!<br>
                Since it doesn’t have the same preserving ingredients as store-bought bread, it’s essential to 
                store it properly, especially on the cut side. Our favorite options are wrapping your bread in plastic 
                wrap or aluminum foil. Then, put the wrapped bread in a resealable plastic bag for extra protection!<br>
                Overall, your bread will likely be best within the first 3-4 days, but it can still be eaten afterwards or 
                even reused as breadcrumbs!</p>

        <button class="accordion">What are the different types of flour?</button>
            <div class="panel" id="faq2">
                <img src="../images/flours.png">
              <p>Many people wonder why they have to go out and specifically buy bread flour for their bread instead of just 
                using the all-purpose flour they already have. Well, there’s a big difference between the types of flours!<br><br>
                <b>Bread flour:</b><br>
                Bread flour has a 12-15% protein content. The high gluten content produces an even structure and a chewy 
                texture inside the bread. <br><br>
                <b>All-purpose flour:</b><br>
                This flour has a 10-13% protein content. It is very versatile and works for all kinds of baked goods,
                since its protein content is right in the middle.<br><br>
                <b>Cake flour:</b><br>
                The third most common flour is cake flour, with only 6-8% protein content. It has a higher starch content, and so it 
                absorbs more liquid than the other flours. The result is softer and more tender, perfect for cakes!
